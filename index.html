              <p class="fst-italic" >Hi baby,
                How are you? This is the first time I write things like this to someone, hope I can use all the English words correctly and perfectly.
              </p>
              <p class="fst-italic">I hope to wake up with you every morning, travel a lot of places with you every year, try different things with you every month, grow up with you every day, build the future and spend the rest of my life with you. I want to let you know no matter what you want to be or what you want to do, I will always be with you and support you. </p>
              <p class="fst-italic">
              I think the first time I had crush on you was at Jojo's birthday party and I didn't know who are you but you looked good at the first sight I swear. I just really thought you are my type. I don't think you noticed me that day lol. Maybe the first time you had a little bit feeling about me was at your house that we talked about business. So, which means I had feeling on you way more before than you had feeling on me,right? However, we finally had something started to happen in December 2021. I don't know what would happen if we didn't hang out and didn't try to know each other. 
              I'm very lucky to have you as my soulmate and meet you in 2021, that's might be the biggest gift for me last year. We are just so match to each other, so just screw the astrology lol. I know we will be so good this year and in the future because we know each other so well and we always have communications which is the most important part in a relationship. I just so in love with you babe. Hope we will be better, nothing can beat us and our love.
              <p class="fst-italic">I wrote above stuff maybe like ten days or seven days ago, and we are way more closer right now which i really like. I can be a true me in front you,but are you sure you are being true you in front me? You don't even want to tell me hey baby, the dress might not be suitable for today's football game party. Luckily, I thought about it myself and took it off, otherwise I would be the one who dressed way too huperbolic (ok, I dont know whether I use the word right or not, but if you did get it, please ask me okokoko). However, tbh, what you said today that you might want to change to be match with me which is really touched me. OK fine, I know you just want me to feel well but I know you won't dress liek that to match me lol. I know ittttt, hahahha. But, If I were you, I would tell you baby, it's better we can change another outfit which is more better.Fine, i should stop, I'm writing the love letter, why would I make it like a blaming one. lol I'm sorry baby. I just want us to be more close and you can say and advice me anything you want.I shouldn't write this because when we review it after 2 years or 10 years later. I would be like wtf, you should write more sweet things lol. I really want to be 0 distance from you my baby</p>
              <p class="fst-italic">Lastly, please remeber, one love, one lifetime, anywhere you go, let me go too.</p>
